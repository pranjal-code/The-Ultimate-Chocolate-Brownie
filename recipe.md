Instructions in steps to make the brownies :

1) Preheat oven to 175°C | 350°F.

2) Lightly grease an 8x12-inch baking pan* with cooking oil spray. Line with parchment paper (or baking paper); set aside.

3) Combine melted butter, oil and sugars together in a medium-sized bowl. Whisk well to combine. Add the eggs and vanilla; beat until lighter in colour (another minute).

4) Sift in flour, cocoa powder and salt. Gently fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until JUST combined (do NOT over beat as doing so well affect the texture of your brownies).

5) Fold in 3/4 of the chocolate pieces.

6) Pour batter into prepared pan, smoothing the top out evenly, and top with remaining chocolate pieces.

7) Bake for 25-30 minutes for just under-done brownies (fudgier texture) or until the centre of the brownies no longer jiggles and is JUST set to the touch.

OR 35-40 minutes if you like your brownies well set and firm.

NOTE: Brownies will continue baking and set in the hot pan out of the oven. If testing with a toothpick, the toothpick should come out dirty for fudge-textured brownies.

8) After 15-20 minutes, carefully remove them out of the pan and allow to cool to room temperature before slicing into 16 brownies. They set while they cool.

ENJOY!

TIPS AND TRICKS:

Do not over beat your batter once the flour and cocoa powder are added. That creates air pockets in the batter which will give you cake-like textured brownies.

Please try not to over bake them. You can go a little bit over if you like them set a bit more, but I don’t recommend it if you’re looking for the fudgiest brownies in the world. Remember, they will continue to bake slightly in the hot pan once pulled out of the oven. Use parchment paper so Ithat you can pull them out of the pan easily after about 10-15 minutes from the oven and place them GENTLY on a cooling rack.
